	<h2>University of Makati</h2>
	<p>The University of Makati traces its roots from <b>Makati Polytechnic Community College</b>, which was founded in 1972. Due to the growing number of curricular offerings, its status was elevated in 1987 to that of a full-fledged college, and was then renamed <b>Makati College</b>. Three years later, it was merged with the former <b>Fort Andres Bonifacio College</b> on January 10, 1990. This event paved the way for the transformation of the college into a university.</p>
